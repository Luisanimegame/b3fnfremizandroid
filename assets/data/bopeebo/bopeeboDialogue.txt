:dad:smug:Hello, boy.
:bf:depressed:boop...
:dad:smug:Is this your first time in front of hundreds of people? 
:bf:depressed:bap...
:dad:smug:I'm guessing that means yes. 
:dad:smug:You know, the language you speak is quite outdated. You're probably one of the only people in the world who speak it.

:dad:smug:I'm saying that it'd be a shame if one of the only people in the world who speak this language fluently-

:bf:angry:bloop!
:dad:angry:But it seems like he doesn't want to live.
:dad:smug:Don't worry, I won't make it TOO hard.
